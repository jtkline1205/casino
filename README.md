# Blackjack
Blackjack is a card game played in many casinos around the world. The player's goal in Blackjack is to "beat the dealer". To beat the dealer, the player must either:

1. Achieve a higher hand total than the dealer does without going over 21.
2. Achieve a hand total at or below 21 while the dealer goes over 21.

The player plays their hand first. The player may choose from the following actions on their turn:
1. Hit - the dealer gives the player another card.
2. Stand - the player stays at their current total and is not dealt any more cards.
3. Double Down - the player adds an additional bet to their current bet (up to the amount of their current bet) and the dealer gives the player one more card.
4. Split - the player creates two hands from their one hand, and plays them out separately. (This can only be done with a pair.)

Once the player has finished playing their hands, the dealer plays his hand. 

Once the dealer has played their hand, the round resolves and the player either wins, loses, or there is a push.
